## üìñ Project Overview
Blackjack Online is a web-based game where players can enjoy a classic Blackjack experience. The project is built using Vite with VanillaJS, ensuring a lightweight and performant application. It follows modern development practices and standards, including:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The game logic is structured using OOP principles, with classes like Card, Deck, Hand, and Blackjack to encapsulate functionality.
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Code is modular and reusable, minimizing duplication.
- Semantic Versioning (SemVer): Versioning follows SemVer conventions (e.g., 1.0.0) for clear release management.
- WCAG 2.1 Guidelines: The project adheres to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 to ensure accessibility for all users, including proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.

## üìú Naming Conventions
To maintain consistency and readability, the project follows these naming conventions:

- File Names: kebab-case (e.g., index.html, new-file.js, reset.css).
- CSS Classes and Variables: kebab-case (e.g., .game-actions-button, --app-white).
- JavaScript Classes: PascalCase (e.g., Blackjack, Card, Deck).
- JavaScript Functions, Variables, and HTML IDs: camelCase (e.g., startNewGame, playerHand, id="dealerScore").
- CSS Units
- Height, Width, Borders: Use px (e.g., width: 125px, border: 1px solid).
- Gap and Margin: Use vh where appropriate (e.g., margin-top: 5vh).
- Other Properties: Prioritize rem for scalability (e.g., font-size: 1.25rem, padding: 0.6rem).

## ‚ôø Accessibility
This project follows WCAG 2.1 guidelines to ensure accessibility for all users:

- ARIA Attributes: Used for dynamic content (e.g., aria-live="assertive" for score updates).
- Keyboard Navigation: All interactive elements (e.g., buttons) are accessible via keyboard.
- Color Contrast: High contrast ratios for text and UI elements.
- Semantic HTML: Proper use of HTML5 elements (e.g., <header>, <main>, <footer>) for better screen reader support.
